Simple Image Encryption Tool Using Pixel Manipulation

The Simple Image Encryption Tool is a Python-based application designed to provide basic image encryption and decryption functionality through pixel manipulation. Utilizing the XOR operation with a user-defined key, this tool offers a straightforward approach to encrypting and decrypting images for educational and illustrative purposes.

Features

1. Pixel-Based Encryption: Encrypts images using XOR operations with a simple key.

2. Decryption: Allows for the decryption of previously encrypted images using the same key.

3. Ease of Use: Simple Python script that can be easily customized and extended.

Use Cases

1. Educational Purposes: Ideal for understanding basic encryption techniques and image processing.

2. Prototyping: Useful for quick, proof-of-concept encryption solutions.

This tool demonstrates fundamental encryption concepts and can be expanded to include more sophisticated encryption methods as needed.

Steps to Use the Tool on Linux:

1. Clone the Repository To get started, first clone the repository from GitHub to your local Linux machine:

git clone https://github.com/CTFxShubh/PRODIGY_CS_Task-02.git

pip install numpy

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc8c5d5b-0aa2-480d-9521-44fb0e0092d2)

3. create the script using nano command 

nano image_encryptor.py

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26519b1f-3c77-4054-919a-9a78a2837387)

4. Write the python code in the file created above and then save it using command Ctrl x,y then press Enter to save the file

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d024be63-f3b0-4bad-aee8-c9cb9163e888)

5. Give the executable permissions to the file

chmod +x image_encryptor.py

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8d0cc4c-4437-4a47-bfd0-ef63a664f0bd)

6. Now run the tool

python image_encryptor.py

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8194a90-ce8e-40ae-be6b-d16510e2c9fe)

7. Now u can see the encrypted and decrypted file in the list directory then use eog tool to open the .png image file

 Here encrypted_image.png

 ![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/147e87e2-d108-4bc8-a977-3caae55141d8)

This is the image that is encrypted
