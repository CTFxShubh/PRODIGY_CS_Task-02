Simple Image Encryption Tool Using Pixel Manipulation

The Simple Image Encryption Tool is a Python-based application designed to provide basic image encryption and decryption functionality through pixel manipulation. Utilizing the XOR operation with a user-defined key, this tool offers a straightforward approach to encrypting and decrypting images for educational and illustrative purposes.

Features

1. Pixel-Based Encryption: Encrypts images using XOR operations with a simple key.

2. Decryption: Allows for the decryption of previously encrypted images using the same key.

3. Ease of Use: Simple Python script that can be easily customized and extended.

Use Cases

1. Educational Purposes: Ideal for understanding basic encryption techniques and image processing.

2. Prototyping: Useful for quick, proof-of-concept encryption solutions.

This tool demonstrates fundamental encryption concepts and can be expanded to include more sophisticated encryption methods as needed.
